The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use website that allows its users to create and adapt their PHP coding standards.

When it comes to coding standards it is not important which one you choose it is just important that you have one and everyone follows it!

To ease the usage of coding standards this site can help you create and/or understand ruleset.xml files for [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/) and [PHPCS](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

When setting up a Continuous Integration environment it can be used complementary to [jenkins-php.org](http://jenkins-php.org) to create the `build/phpmd.xml` and `build/phpcs.xml` files but of course works fine on its own with the command line versions of the respective tools and other Continuous Integration servers.
